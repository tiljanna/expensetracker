  </div>



### Introduction

Welcome to the Expense and Income Tracker Back-End project! This robust system is designed to efficiently manage users and transactions, providing a seamless experience for tracking expenses and income. Built with cutting-edge technologies, this project utilizes Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Mongoose ODM, JWT authentication, and RESTful API endpoints. Additionally, the system incorporates mailing functionality to enhance communication.

### Technologies Used

- **Node.js:** The project is powered by Node.js, a powerful JavaScript runtime known for its scalability and performance. Node.js enables efficient server-side development.

- **Express.js:** As a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework, Express.js simplifies the development of robust and scalable APIs, making it an excellent choice for this back-end project.

- **MongoDB:** A NoSQL database, MongoDB is used for storing and managing data efficiently. Its flexibility allows for easy adaptation to changing requirements.

- **Mongoose ODM:** Mongoose is employed as the Object-Document Mapper (ODM) for MongoDB, providing a straightforward way to model and interact with the database.

- **JWT Authentication:** JSON Web Token (JWT) authentication is implemented to ensure secure user sessions, providing a reliable and token-based authentication mechanism.

- **REST API:** The project follows the principles of Representational State Transfer (REST), providing a standardized and scalable architecture for building APIs.

- **Node Mailer:** The inclusion of mailing functionality enhances communication within the system, allowing users to receive important updates and notifications.

### Deployment

The project is live and deployed on [https://bosso-expense-tracker.onrender.com/](https://bosso-expense-tracker.onrender.com/). This deployment allows users to interact with the system and test its features using tools like POSTMAN API.

### Key Features

1. **User Management:** The system provides robust user management capabilities, allowing users to register, log in securely, and manage their profiles.

2. **Transaction Tracking:** Users can efficiently track both expenses and income, providing a comprehensive overview of their financial activities.

3. **Authentication and Security:** JWT authentication ensures secure access to the system, protecting user data and maintaining the integrity of transactions.

4. **RESTful API:** The project follows RESTful principles, allowing developers to interact with the back end seamlessly and integrate the system into various applications.

5. **Mailing Integration:** The inclusion of mailing functionality enhances communication, keeping users informed about important updates and transactions.

### How to Test
1. Fork then Clone the repository.

2. `npm install` to install dependencies, I'll leave the fun and the way to run the project to you, figure it out if you don't 😄.

To explore the project, you can use tools like POSTMAN API to interact with the deployed API endpoints. Feel free to register, log in, and test various features provided by the Expense and Income Tracker.

### Conclusion

The Expense and Income Tracker Back-End project is a testament to modern web development practices, leveraging powerful technologies to create a scalable, secure, and efficient system.
